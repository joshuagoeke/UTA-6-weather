# UTA Bootcamp Challenge 6

In this homework assignment from the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp we were asked to create a weather app that utilizes several locations and gives a forecast based on that location.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Shout out to Chris Zavala for helping me figure out the Unix time conversions, and to Sara Pereira for helping me figure out the event listener for the recent searches buttons.
